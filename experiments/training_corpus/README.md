# Benchmark for installation instructions of software repositories
---
This folder aims to keep track of the experiements related to the research question:

* can machines interpret and execute installation plans for biomedical software?

### Selection criteria [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) :
The repositories will be selected on community-curated list of software packages:
+ bioinformatics software documentation ([e.g](https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2022-10-22-awesome-lists/));
+ part of [awesome-healthcare list](https://github.com/kakoni/awesome-healthcare) or;
+ part of [awesome-ai-devtools](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/awesome-ai-devtools);
+ part of [awesome-neuroscience](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/awesome-neuroscience);
+ part of [biological image analysis](https://github.com/hallvaaw/awesome-biological-image-analysis)

Also thinking about LLMs for bioinformatics
