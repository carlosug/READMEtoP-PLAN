# Benchmark for installation instructions of software repositories
---
This folder aims to keep track of the experiements related to the research question:

* can machines interpret and execute installation plans for biomedical software?

### Selection criteria:
The repositories will be selected one or more reasons:
+ bioinformatics software documentation;
+ part of [awesome-healthcare list](https://github.com/kakoni/awesome-healthcare) or;
+ part of [awesome-ai-devtools](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/awesome-ai-devtools);
+ part of [awesome-neuroscience](https://github.com/analyticalmonk/awesome-neuroscience);
