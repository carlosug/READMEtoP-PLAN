Set your [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/docs#api-keys) (default) and/or your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (to use the OpenAI API directly...in this case, set --model to `gpt-4-32k` or your desired model) and install the python requirements:\n",

(Optional) If you'd like GPT-Migrate to validate the unit tests it creates against your app before it tests the migrated app with them, please have your existing app exposed and use the `--sourceport` flag. For executing this against the benchmark, open a separate terminal, navigate to the `benchmarks/language-pair/source` directory, and run `python app.py` after installing the requirements. It will expose on port 5000. Use this with the `--sourceport` flag.\n",

      "\n",
      "- `--temperature`: Temperature setting for the AI model. Default is `0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--sourcedir`: Source directory containing the code to be migrated. Default is `\"../benchmarks/flask-nodejs/source\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--sourcelang`: Source language or framework of the code to be migrated. No default value.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--sourceentry`: Entrypoint filename relative to the source directory. For instance, this could be an `app.py` or `main.py` file for Python. Default is `\"app.py\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--targetdir`: Directory where the migrated code will live. Default is `\"../benchmarks/flask-nodejs/target\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--targetlang`: Target language or framework for migration. Default is `\"nodejs\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--operating_system`: Operating system for the Dockerfile. Common options are `'linux'` or `'windows'`. Default is `'linux'`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--testfiles`: Comma-separated list of files that have functions to be tested. For instance, this could be an `app.py` or `main.py` file for a Python app where your REST endpoints are. Include the full relative path. Default is `\"app.py\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--sourceport`: (Optional) Port for testing the unit tests file against the original app. No default value. If not included, GPT-Migrate will not attempt to test the unit tests against your original app.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--targetport`: Port for testing the unit tests file against the migrated app. Default is `8080`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--guidelines`: Stylistic or small functional guidelines that you'd like to be followed during the migration. For instance, \"Use tabs, not spaces\". Default is an empty string.\n",
      "\n",
      "- `--step`: Step to run. Options are `'setup'`, `'migrate'`, `'test'`, `'all'`. Default is `'all'`.\n",

      "  - Both Rift Chat and Code Edit see a window around your cursor or selection in the currently active editor window. To tell them about other resources in your codebase, mention them with `@`.\n",
      "  - Code Edit \n",
      "- You can `@`-mention files and directories to tell your agents about other parts of the codebase.\n",
