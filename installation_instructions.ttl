We provide a Docker image with SOMEF already installed. To run through Docker, you may build the Dockerfile provided in the repository by running:

```bash
docker build -t somef .
```
Or just use the Docker image already built in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcapd/somef):

```bash
docker pull kcapd/somef
```

Then, to run your image just type:

```bash
docker run -it kcapd/somef /bin/bash
```

And you will be ready to use SOMEF (see section below). If you want to have access to the results we recommend [mounting a volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). For example, the following command will mount the current directory as the `out` folder in the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD/:/out kcapd/somef /bin/bash
```
If you move any files produced by somef into `/out`, then you will be able to see them in your current directory.""" .
