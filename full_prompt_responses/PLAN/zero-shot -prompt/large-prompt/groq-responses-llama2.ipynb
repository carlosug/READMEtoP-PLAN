If you want to run the code on bare metal jump [Native installation](#Native-installation). First, install Docker on your machine. Then move to the original directory `learning_to_fly` and build the Docker image: ``` docker build -t arpllab/learning_to_fly . ``` If desired you can also build the container for building the firmware: ``` docker build -t arpllab/learning_to_fly_build_firmware -f Dockerfile_build_firmware . ``` After that you can run it using e.g.: ``` docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 arpllab/learning_to_fly ``` This will open the port `8000` for the UI of the training program and run it inside the container. Navigate to [https://0.0.0.0:8000](https://0.0.0.0:8000) with your browser, and you should see something like in the screenshot above (after starting the training). The training UI configuration does not log data by default. If you want to inspect the training data run: ``` docker run -it --rm -p 6006:6006 arpllab/learning_to_fly training_headless ``` Navigate to [https://0.0.0.0:6006](https://0.0.0.0:6006) with your browser to investigate the Tensorboard logs. If you would like to benchmark the training speed you can use: ``` docker run -it --rm arpllab/learning_to_fly training_benchmark ``` This is the fastest configuration, without logging, UI, checkpointing etc. ### Native installation Clone this repository: ``` git clone https://github.com/arplaboratory/learning-to-fly learning_to_fly cd learning_to_fly ``` Then instantiate the `RLtools` submodule: ``` git submodule update --init -- external/rl_tools cd external/rl_tools ``` Then instantiate some dependencies of `RLtools` (for conveniences like checkpointing, Tensorboard logging, testing, etc.): ``` git submodule update --init -- external/cli11 external/highfive external/json/ external/tensorboard tests/lib/googletest/ ``` #### Install dependencies on Ubuntu ``` sudo apt update && sudo apt install libhdf5-dev libopenblas-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libboost-all-dev ``` As an alternative to openblas you can also install [Intel MKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-download.html) which in our experience is significantly faster than OpenBLAS. #### Install dependencies on macOS ``` brew install hdf5 protobuf boost ``` Please make sure that `brew` links the libraries correctly. If not you might have to link e.g. `protobuf` manually using `brew link protobuf`. Going back to the main directory (`learning_to_fly`), we can now configure the build of the code: ``` cd ../../ mkdir build cd build ``` - Ubuntu + OpenBLAS: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_OPENBLAS:BOOL=ON` - Ubuntu + MKL: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRL_TOOLS_BACKEND_ENABLE_MKL:BOOL=ON` - macOS (tested on Sonoma): `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` Finally, we can build the targets: ``` cmake --build . -j8 ``` After successfully building the targets, we can run the code (in the original directory `learning_to_fly`): ``` cd .. ./build/src/training_headless ``` While this is running, you should be able to see training metrics using Tensorboard If not already installed: ``` python3 -m pip install tensorboard ``` Then from the original directory `learning_to_fly`: ``` tensorboard --logdir=logs ``` To run the training with the UI, we download the JavaScript dependencies in the form of the two files `three.module.js` and `OrbitControls.js`: ``` cd src/ui ./get_dependencies.sh ``` After that we can execute the UI binary from the root folder: ``` cd ../../ ./build/src/ui 0.0.0.0 8000 ``` Now you should be able to navigate to [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) in your browser and start the training. To run the benchmark (with UI, checkpointing and Tensorboard logging turned off): ``` sudo nice -n -20 ./build/src/training_benchmark ```.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"\n",

You should install 🤗 Transformers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/). First, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you're going to use and activate it. Then, you will need to install at least one of Flax, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. Please refer to [TensorFlow installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) and/or [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax#quick-install) and [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) installation pages regarding the specific installation command for your platform. When one of those backends has been installed, 🤗 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows: ```bash pip install transformers ``` If you'd like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can't wait for a new release, you must [install the library from source](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#installing-from-source). ### With conda 🤗 Transformers can be installed using conda as follows: ```shell script conda install conda-forge::transformers ``` > **_NOTE:_** Installing `transformers` from the `huggingface` channel is deprecated. Follow the installation pages of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow to see how to install them with conda. > **_NOTE:_** On Windows, you may be prompted to activate Developer Mode in order to benefit from caching. If this is not an option for you, please let us know in [this issue](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues/1062).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"\n",

Modify [settings/example.json](./settings/example.json) on your desired processing procedure. The configuration file may contains many options.

Copy raw data to input_path in `settings/example.json`. And make sure the output_path not exists, otherwise the output path will be overwritten. ```{commandline} pip install -r requirements.txt cp <raw_data> /path/to/input_path ``` Then the processing pipeline will generate an `debug_report.json` into /path/to/report_path defined in `settings/example.json`. The report displayed filter ratio of each filter rules, as well as match ratio, time cost and match cases of each regular expression cleaner rules and so on. ```{commandline} python main.py --conf settings/example.json ``` After running the processing pipeline, the cleaned data will be merged as a `.jsonl` file, while there is just one record in a line.

Use Conda or Pip to create a venv for python 3.11, we are using conda for this example: ```bash conda create --name spineps python=3.11 conda activate spineps conda install pip ``` 2. Go to <a href=`https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/`>https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/</a> and install a correct pytorch version for your machine in your venv 3. Confirm that your pytorch package is working! Try calling these commands: ```bash nvidia-smi ``` This should show your GPU and it's usage. ```bash python -c `import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())` ``` This should throw no errors and return True.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\"\n",
